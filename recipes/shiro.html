      <ol>
        <li>
        <p>
            On a large skillet, dry roast ¾ cup of chickpea flour along with a tablespoon of berbere spice, <br>
            and 1 teaspoon each of ground cardamom, white cumin powder, and garlic powder. Set aside.<br> 
            You can add the salt now or wait until later.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                In a medium sized pot or Dutch oven, heat ⅓ cup of olive oil on low to medium heat. <br>
                Add 1 diced onion over low to medium heat for a few minutes. This is just to get <br>
                the aromatics fragrant so 1-2 minutes is sufficient, don't let it brown!
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Next, add a teaspoon of minced garlic along with the tomato paste and sauté <br>
                for 30 seconds until the garlic is fragrant.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Now, add the shiro powder, along with salt and 3 cups of water, and bring to a boil on medium heat.<br>
                Then, turn down the heat to a low to medium, and let it simmer for about 20 to 30 minutes to allow the<br>
                mixture to thicken to your desired consistency. Stir at 5 minute increments to ensure it doesn't stick.<br>
                The oil will float to the top when the shiro is done cooking! Taste and adjust salt and serve hot with rice or injera!
